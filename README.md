It consists of a website which lets users map individual spots of happyness in the Styrian capital Graz. It also lets users map spots which 
are particularly green. Furthermore, it collects demographic data, such as age and gender.

The collected data is stored in a connected supabase database. Based on this data, correlations between perceptions of happiness and greenness in an urban environment are calculated. Through the collection of demographic data, differences in population-groups can be inferenced.
